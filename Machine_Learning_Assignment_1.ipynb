Typically, when a dataset fits neatly into a computer's main memory, randomly accessing sections of data has a (relatively) small performance penalty. Out-of-core learning refers to the machine learning algorithms working with data that cannot fit into a single machine's memory but can easily fit into some data storage, such as a local hard disk or web repository."
